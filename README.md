object-oriented-javascript-christmas-lights
===========================================

I made these object-oriented Javascript Christmas lights for my website during the Christmas holidays in 2013,
and thought Iâ€™d share how I did it with this simplified, stand-alone version.

My blog post about [object-oriented Javascript](http://forrest-tanaka.com/javascript-object-oriented-christmas-lights/) shows how it works, and should be a good introduction to clean object-oriented
Javascript for people unfamiliar with it.
